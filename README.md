# AppArchitectureExample

You can run the app using two environments:


1. **AppArchitectureExampleMock** 

This target runs the app in the Mock environment. The compile time is faster


2. **AppArchitectureExample**
   
  This target runs the app in the Production environment with Live dependencies. In this app example, both environments use the same code, but for the long compile time simulation we added a heavy parsable code for the live dependencies
